Numerical solver for liquid jet pumps with three-phase flow (LJ3P).   
#### Background
Jet pump studies fron the 1970's were interested in pumping single phase incompressible flows or single phase compressible flows. The models produced relied on assumptions such as constant density or an ideal gas to analytically solve the equations. In 1995 Cunningham wrote a paper with equations that govern a water jet for pumping a two-phase mixture. The equations relied on constant density of the liquid and ideal gas law for the solution.
